# A Star Path Finding


#### A* Path Finding Algorithm using Python

This is an implementation of the A* Path Finding Algorithm in Python, using the Pygame library for visualization. The algorithm finds the shortest path between a given start and end point on a grid.

#### Usage

To run the algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install the Pygame library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

 pip install pygame

3. Create a new Python file and copy the provided code into it.

4. Run the Python script, and a Pygame window will open.

5. The Pygame window displays a grid. Left-click to set the start and end points. Right-click to create barriers. Press the spacebar to start the algorithm, which will find the shortest path. Press 'c' to clear the grid and start over.

6. The algorithm will visualize the search process by updating the grid colors. Once the shortest path is found, it will be displayed in purple.

Example

Here is an example of how to use the A* Path Finding Algorithm:

import pygame

import math

from queue import PriorityQueue

# Rest of the code...

# ...

def main(win, width):

    # Rest of the code...

    # ...

main(WIN, WIDTH)

##### Requirements

Python 3.x

Pygame

Make sure to install the required libraries mentioned above before running the code.
